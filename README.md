start-here resource list for people falling in the crypto rabbit-hole

## Genesis

We've started in 2018 with the goal of adding blockchain project in 42 holly graph and helping peers meet and share their passion.
 
We have organised events & workshop and made  couple of videos you can find here:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq8m9yakyA5b6ZlyWtEV2jA

You can find the official git here:
https://github.com/42-Blockchain/

We worked on different projects (btc wallet, solidity bootcamp, bonding curve tutorial) but nothing was release because it wasn't finished and the people working on it were at capacity with other stuff.

We can't dedicated the time we used to for the association, we are looking for new blood that want to take the torch and continue the mission - bonding together and level up in smart contract development.

This discord is free for anyone to do what they want (you can organise your events here or share what you like) as long as it's respectful! Don't hesitate to dm @Th0t_nz1g or me if you have questions!
